        This extraction is faster than using a `DirectedEdgeExtractor` when the IDs
        are available since it doesn't need to look-up the nodes associated with a
        given tag.

        NOTE: If no edges are specified, no edges will be created. If edge(s)
        are specified and the target node doesn't exist, an error will be
        raised. This means the target must be added in the same or an earlier
        batch of nodes.

            edges_field: The metadata field containing the IDs of nodes to link to.
