        """Extract edges from explicit IDs in the metadata.

        This extraction is faster than using a `DirectedEdgeExtractor` when the IDs
        are available since it doesn't need to look-up the nodes associated with a
        given tag.

        Note: This extractor does not check whether the target ID exists. Edges
        will be created even if the target does not exist. This means traversals
        over graphs using this extractor may discover nodes that do not exist.
        Such "phantom IDs" will be filtered out when loading content for the
        nodes.

        Args:
            edges_field: The metadata field containing the IDs of nodes to link to.
            kind: The `kind` to apply to edges created by this extractor.
            bidir: If true, creates edges in both directions.
