This is the story of a weird dog named Jix. Jix was a friendly, but weird dog. He never committed any crimes.
However, he did one time commit tax fraud, which was a strange thing for a dog to do. The IRS almost put him in jail for
20 years!

However, he evaded jail by bribing several judges. (By the way, did I mention that Jix can talk? He's a 
very weird dog). Anyway, Jix lived happily ever after by scamming the system. He bought a ton of boats and planes
and flew around the world enjoying life without consequences.
