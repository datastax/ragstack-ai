Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19].

In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3    Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n                                                    2\\n---\\n                                                          Output\\n                                                        Probabilities\\n                                                          Softmax\\n                                                           Linear\\n                                                        Add & Norm\\n                                                            Feed\\n                                                          Forward\\n                                                        Add & Norm\\n                                    Add   Norm           Multi-Head\\n                                       Feed               Attention\\n                                      Forward                              Nx\\n                         Nx         Add & Norm          Add & Norm\\n                                                           Masked\\n                                     Multi-Head          Multi-Head\\n                                      Attention           Attention\\n                       Positional                                      Positional\\n                       Encoding        Input               Output     Encoding\\n                                    Embedding            Embedding\\n                                      Inputs             Outputs\\n                                                       (shifted right)\\n                           Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1   Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:     The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2   Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n                                                   3\\n---\\n           Scaled Dot-Product Attention                                Multi-Head Attention\\n                          MatMul                                              Linear\\n                     SoftMax                                                 Concat\\n                    Mask (opt:)                                        Scaled Dot-Product\\n                      Scale                                                  Attention\\n                     MatMul                                         Linear    Linear   Linear\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\n                               Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT     √  dk  )V                             (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\n     1\\nof √ dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\n                                                                                              1\\nextremely small gradients 4.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3     Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n          • In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\n             and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\n             position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\n             typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n             [38, 2, 9].\\n          • The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\n             and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\n             encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\n             encoder.\\n          • Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\n             all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\n             information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\n             inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\n             of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3     Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\n                                          FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2                                                            (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4     Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n                                                                     5\\n---\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.', start_char_idx=14429, end_char_idx=19254, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='31c914ae-0e8f-4f4f-a354-bae3fd029152', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': './attention.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6c9edaa9-35e7-4b06-b470-27016d6d4a88', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_path': './attention.pdf'}, hash='4d5a7515003ce9a74923078283da5a554b901cd586b9211907aba1c1f0fd2a60'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='d209b5f4-180d-4370-a365-7ec2b4c7a4fb', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'file_path': './attention.pdf'}, hash='b33f34bac1e900cd6a56de9cfd491d80bcad01e7f85c85c4cc4a4f732c0226e2'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='50a1e0b7-43b7-4145-832c-d399747fcbb9', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='f44934fc26f90144d31f5edf450d47f4a06d7d7500f72a76a5282733c7d2eeff')}, text='3.4     Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel.

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\n                                  PE  (pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\n                                PE  (pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4    Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈     Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n                                                    6\\n---\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations.', start_char_idx=18364, end_char_idx=23117, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='50a1e0b7-43b7-4145-832c-d399747fcbb9', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': './attention.pdf'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6c9edaa9-35e7-4b06-b470-27016d6d4a88', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_path': './attention.pdf'}, hash='4d5a7515003ce9a74923078283da5a554b901cd586b9211907aba1c1f0fd2a60'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='31c914ae-0e8f-4f4f-a354-bae3fd029152', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'file_path': './attention.pdf'}, hash='f4c0f0110d18acc70bb308baeaef1138148fdac9811a35b3fc3dc85d5c3d5976'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6ede8763-c0e2-402a-93f9-53ba30c2417c', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='8c7f95aca8c6aa9a0da0a30ab8979dcd8cad3fbb886ef0e16ebc694a6e8f5e9e')}, text='The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12].

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5    Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1   Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2   Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds.
