    "This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate a RAG pipeline using LangChain's [QA Evaluator](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/evaluation/evaluator-implementations#correctness-qa-evaluation). This evaluator helps measure the correctness of a response given some context, which makes it ideally suited for evaluating a RAG pipeline. At the end of this notebook, you will have a measurable QA model using RAG.\n",

Dramatic Irony: The reader knows more than the characters, as they are aware of Montresor\\'s plan to wall up Fortunato. This creates tension as the reader wonders when and how Fortunato will discover the truth.\\n\\n3. Repetition: The repetition of certain phrases and sounds, such as Fortunato\\'s laughter and the word \"he,\" adds to the suspense and creates a sense of unease.\\n\\n4. Symbolism: The use of the catacombs, bones, and darkness as symbols of death and decay adds to the overall sense of dread and impending doom.\\n\\n5. Unreliable Narrator: Montresor, the narrator, is not a reliable source of information, leading the reader to question his motives and actions. This uncertainty adds to the tension and suspense.\\n\\n6. Setting: The story takes place in a dark and eerie catacomb, which creates a sense of claustrophobia and adds to the overall atmosphere of suspense.\\n\\n7. Descriptive Language: Poe\\'s use of vivid and detailed descriptions, particularly of the catacombs and the process of walling up Fortunato, heightens the tension and creates a vivid sense of horror.\\n\\nThese techniques work together to create a sense of unease, anticipation, and dread throughout the story, building suspense and keeping the reader engaged.',\n",

This setting allows the narrator to carry out his plan of revenge against Fortunato without arousing suspicion. The carnival season is known for its atmosphere of indulgence and excess, which helps to create a sense of irony and contrast with the dark and sinister events unfolding in the story. Additionally, the carnival season represents a time when social norms and hierarchies are temporarily suspended, allowing the narrator to manipulate and deceive Fortunato more easily.',\n",
