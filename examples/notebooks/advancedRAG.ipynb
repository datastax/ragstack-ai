    "This notebook describes two different Advanced RAG techniques: MultiQueryRAG and ParentDocumentRAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **MultiQueryRAG**, an LLM is used to automate the process of prompt tuning, to generate multiple queries from \n",
    "different perspectives for a given user input question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **ParentDocumentRAG**, documents are split first into larger \"parent\" chunks, and then into smaller \"child\"\n",
    "chunks so that their embeddings can more accurately reflect their meaning. Then between retrieval and inference, \n",
    "each smaller \"child\" chunk is replaced with its larger \"parent\" chunk. This provides more context to the \n",
    "model to answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both of these techniques can increase the response accuracy, they also can have some drawbacks. Often they\n",
    "take longer to execute, and they can cost more due to increased LLM invocations and/or increased token usage."
