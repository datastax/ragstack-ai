    "# Foward-Looking Augmented REtrieval (FLARE)\n",
    "\n",
    "FLARE is an advanced retrieval technique that combines retrieval and generation in LLMs. It enhances the accuracy of responses by iteratively predicting the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content when the model encounters a token it is uncertain about. See the [original repository](https://github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE/tree/main) for more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow is: \n",
    "1. Send a query\n",
    "2. The model generates tokens while iteratively predicting the upcoming sentence\n",
    "3. If the model sees a token with a low confidence level, it uses the predicted sentence as a query to retrieve new, relevant documents\n",
    "4. The upcoming sentence is regenerated using the retrieved documents\n",
    "5. Repeat 2-4 until the response is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use an Astra DB vector store, an OpenAI embedding model, an OpenAI LLM, and LangChain to orchestrate FLARE in a RAG pipeline. "
