    "# Forward-Looking Augmented REtrieval (FLARE)\n",
    "\n",
    "FLARE is an advanced retrieval technique that combines retrieval and generation in LLMs. It enhances the accuracy of responses by iteratively predicting the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content when the model encounters a token it is uncertain about. See the [original repository](https://github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE/tree/main) for more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow is: \n",
    "1. Send a query\n",
    "2. The model generates tokens while iteratively predicting the upcoming sentence\n",
    "3. If the model sees a token with a low confidence level, it uses the predicted sentence as a query to retrieve new, relevant documents\n",
    "4. The upcoming sentence is regenerated using the retrieved documents\n",
    "5. Repeat 2-4 until the response is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use an Astra DB vector store, an OpenAI embedding model, an OpenAI LLM, and LangChain to orchestrate FLARE in a RAG pipeline. "

      "\"The nitre!\" I said; \"see, it increases.  It hangs like moss upon the\n",
      "vaults.  We are below the river's bed.  The drops of moisture trickle\n",
      "among the bones.  Come, we will go back ere it is too late.  Your\n",
      "cough--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is nothing,\" he said; \"let us go on.  But first, another draught of\n",
      "the Medoc.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I broke and reached him a flagon of De Grave.  He emptied it at a\n",
      "breath.  His eyes flashed with a fierce light.  He laughed and threw\n",
      "the bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked at him in surprise.  He repeated the movement--a grotesque one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You do not comprehend?\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Not I,\" I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then you are not of the brotherhood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are not of the masons.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" I said; \"yes, yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You?  Impossible!  A mason?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A mason,\" I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A sign,\" he said, \"a sign.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is this,\" I answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of\n",
      "my _roquelaire_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You jest,\" he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.  \"But let us proceed\n",
      "to the Amontillado.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Be it so,\" I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again\n",
      "offering him my arm.  He leaned upon it heavily.  We continued our\n",
      "route in search of the Amontillado.  We passed through a range of low\n",
      "arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep\n",
      "crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to\n",
      "glow than flame.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less\n",
      "spacious.  Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the\n",
      "vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.  Three\n",
      "sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.\n",
      "From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay\n",
      "promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some\n",
      "size.  Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we\n",
      "perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet in width\n",
      "three, in height six or seven.  It seemed to have been constructed for\n",
      "no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between\n",
      "two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was\n",
      "backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to\n",
      "pry into the depth of the recess.  Its termination the feeble light did\n",
      "not enable us to see.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Proceed,\" I said; \"herein is the Amontillado.  As for Luchesi--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He is an ignoramus,\" interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily\n",
      "forward, while I followed immediately at his heels.  In an instant he\n",
      "had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress\n",
      "arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.  A moment more and I\n",
      "had fettered him to the granite.  In its surface were two iron staples,\n",
      "distant from each other about two feet, horizontally.  From one of\n",
      "these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock.  Throwing the\n",
      "links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure\n",
      "it.  He was too much astounded to resist.  Withdrawing the key I\n",
      "stepped back from the recess.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pass your hand,\" I said, \"over the wall; you cannot help feeling the\n",
      "nitre.  Indeed, it is _very_ damp.  Once more let me _implore_ you to\n",
      "return.  No?  Then I must positively leave you.  But I must first\n",
      "render you all the little attentions in my power.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Amontillado!\" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his\n",
      "astonishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"True,\" I replied; \"the Amontillado.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of which\n",
      "I have before spoken.  Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered a quantity\n",
      "of building stone and mortar.  With these materials and with the aid of\n",
      "my trowel, I began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered\n",
      "that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off. The\n",
      "earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth\n",
      "of the recess.  It was _not_ the cry of a drunken man. There was then a\n",
      "long and obstinate silence.  I laid the second tier, and the third, and\n",
      "the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain.  The\n",
      "noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to\n",
      "it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labours and sat down upon\n",
      "the bones. When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel,\n",
      "and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh\n",
      "tier.  The wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast.  I again\n",
      "paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few\n",
      "feeble rays upon the figure within.\n",
      "\n",
      "A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the\n",
      "throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back.  For a\n",
      "brief moment I hesitated--I trembled.  Unsheathing my rapier, I began\n",
      "to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant\n",
      "reassured me.  I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs,\n",
      "and felt satisfied.  I reapproached the wall; I replied to the yells of\n",
      "him who clamoured.  I re-echoed--I aided--I surpassed them in volume\n",
      "and in strength.  I did this, and the clamourer grew still.\n",
