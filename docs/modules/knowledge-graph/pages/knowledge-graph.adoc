= Knowledge Graph RAG


== How is Knowledge Graph different from RAG?

Short answer: it isn't. Knowledge graphs are a method of doing RAG, but with a different representation of the information.

RAG with similarity search creates a vector representation of information based on chunks of text. The query is compared to the question, and the most similar chunks are returned as the answer.

Knowledge graph RAG extracts a knowledge graph from information, and stores the graph representation in a vector or graph knowledge store.

Instead of a similarity search query, the graph store is **traversed** to extract a sub-graph of the knowledge graph's edges and properties. For example, a query for "Marie Curie" returns a sub-graph of nodes representing her relationships, accomplishments, and other relevant information - the context.

You're telling the graph store to "start with this node, and show me the relationships to a depth of 2 nodes outwards."
