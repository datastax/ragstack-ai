= Retrieve Documents

We recommend LangChain's OpenAIEmbeddings class to embed queries and retrieve documents from {db-serverless}.

== Basic retrieval

. This retriever uses the OpenAIEmbeddings class to embed the query and retrieve the ten most similar documents from the {db-serverless} vector store.
The `(search_kwargs={'k': 10})` parameter means that when a query is performed against the database, the retriever will return the top 10 closest matches based on the vector embeddings.

The context is a passage from the story "The Cask of Amontillado" by Edgar Allan Poe. The narrator, who has been insulted by a man named Fortunato, seeks revenge. He lures Fortunato into a catacomb under the pretense of tasting a rare wine called Amontillado. Once they are deep in the catacombs, the narrator chains Fortunato to a wall and walls him up alive. The narrator then describes how he finishes the wall and leaves Fortunato to die. The passage also mentions the narrator's motivation for revenge and his expertise in wine.

== Retrieval with multiple questions

Build an iterative retriever to ask multiple questions.

. Create a basic prompt template and a set of questions.

    "How is vivid and descriptive language used in the story?",
    "Is there any foreshadowing in the story? If yes, how is it used in the story?"

Question: How is vivid and descriptive language used in the story?

Vivid and descriptive language is used in the story to create a sense of atmosphere and to immerse the reader in the events taking place. The language paints a detailed picture of the setting, such as the granite walls, the iron staples, and the bones in the recess. It also conveys the emotions and actions of the characters, such as the protagonist's astounded reaction and the chained form's low moaning cry. The language is used to evoke a sense of suspense and horror, as well as to emphasize the intensity of the events unfolding.

----------------------------------------
Question: Is there any foreshadowing in the story? If yes, how is it used in the story?

Yes, there is foreshadowing in the story. The narrator's mention of the "supreme madness of the carnival season" and the fact that he encounters Fortunato during this time hints at the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the events that will unfold. Additionally, the repeated references to the Amontillado wine and the narrator's insistence on taking Fortunato to see it foreshadow the trap that the narrator has set for Fortunato in the catacombs.
