In AsciiDoc, creating paragraphs is a straightforward process that does not require any special markup.
A paragraph can be defined as one or more lines of consecutive text that are logically grouped together.
To differentiate between paragraphs, you simply need to insert at least one blank line between them.

// When creating paragraphs in AsciiDoc, it's inefficient to write entire paragraphs on a single line.
// Instead, put each sentence on its own line, a technique known as _ventilated prose_.
// This technique is similar to how you write and organize source code.
// The result can be spectacular.

== Level 1 section title

A section title marks the beginning of a section and also acts as the heading for that section.
The section title must be prefixed with a section marker, which indicates the section level.
The number of equal signs in the marker represents the section level using a 0-based index.

This section represents a level 1 because the section title -- *Level 1 section title* -- is prefixed with two equal signs (`==`) in the AsciiDoc markup.

[.header-noline]
== Level 1 section title w/ custom role (no line)

Apply `[.header-noline]` to level 1 section titles to remove the line that normally appears below the section title.

=== Level 2 section title

In the HTML output, the section title is represented by a heading tag.
The number of the heading tag is one more than the section level (e.g., section level 1 becomes an h2 tag).
The section level ranges from 0-5.
This limit was established primarily due to the fact that HTML only provides heading tags from h1 to h6 (making level 5 the upper limit).

==== Level 3 section title

Section levels must be nested logically.

Section levels cannot be skipped when nesting sections (e.g., you can't nest a level 5 section directly inside a level 3 section; an intermediary level 4 section is required).

===== Level 4 section title

In addition to the equals sign marker used for defining section titles, Asciidoctor recognizes the hash symbol (`#`) from Markdown.
That means the outline of a Markdown document will be converted just fine as an AsciiDoc document.
(But you shouldn't be using Markdown!)

====== Level 5 section title

When the document is converted to HTML 5 (using the built-in `html5` backend), each section title becomes a heading element where the heading level matches the number of equal signs.
For example, a level 1 section (`==`) maps to an `<h2>` element.

== Text formatting

A bold *word*, and a bold *phrase of text*.
Bold c**hara**cter**s** within a word.

An italic _word_, and an italic _phrase of text_.
Italic c__hara__cter__s__ within a word.

A monospace `word`, and a monospace `phrase of text`.
Monospace c``hara``cter``s`` within a word.

That *_really_* has to go.
Can't pick one?
Let's use them `*_all_*`.

A highlighted #word#, and a highlighted #phrase of text#.
Highlighted c##hara##cter##s## within a word.

Where did all the [.underline]#cores# go?

=== Links

==== Internal link

Instead of having to enclose text within <<text-formatting,tags or special characters>>, you can focus on expressing your ideas and content in a clear and concise manner.

==== External link

.NOTE: The three links below should all have the same styling and behavior (click for explanation)
[%collapsible]
====
An _external link_ is any link that targets an address outside of the `docs.datastax.com` subdomain.
External links should always have the following behavior, regardless of any AsciiDoc attributes that a writer might apply to them:

* Different visual styling than an internal link, e.g. an `open_in_new` icon after the link text.
* Open in a new tab when clicked.

The links in the example sentences below all target the same external URL -- `\https://www.datastax.com`.
However, they each have different AsciiDoc attributes applied to them.

[source,asciidoc]
----
External links have a special icon and open in a new tab https://www.datastax.com[when clicked,role=external,window=_blank].
External links have a special icon and open in a new tab https://www.datastax.com[when clicked^].
External links have a special icon and open in a new tab https://www.datastax.com[when clicked].
----

The UI should disregard these attributes and apply the same styling and behavior to each link.

If an xref fails to resolve, the https://example.org[link text,role=unresolved] is displayed as-is, but in red.

=== Keyboard, button, and menu macros

To save the file, select menu:File[Save].

.Another admonition
[CAUTION]
======
Admonition styles are set on example blocks, which are delimited by four equal signs (`====`).
When nesting a delimited block that uses the same structural container, it's necessary to vary the length of the delimiter lines (i.e., make the length of the delimiter lines for the child block different than the length of the delimiter lines for the parent block).
Varying the delimiter line length allows the parser to distinguish one block from another.

A paragraph can be defined as one or more lines of consecutive text that are logically grouped together. To differentiate between paragraphs, you simply need to insert at least one blank line between them.

=== More blocks

As you might have seen in the examples further up on this page -- any block can have a title.
A block title is defined using a line of text above the block that starts with a dot.
That dot cannot be followed by a space.
For block images, the title is typically displayed below the block.
For all other blocks, the title is typically displayed above it.

==== Example block

.Optional title
====
An example block is useful for visually delineating content that illustrates a concept or showing the result of an operation.

An example can contain any type of content and AsciiDoc syntax.

Here's a sample AsciiDoc document:

[#listing-block]
==== Listing block

A listing block is just a <<code-blocks,code block>>, but without the `source` style applied.
(All code blocks are listing blocks, but not all listing blocks are code blocks.)

.Optional title
----
This is a _delimited listing block_.

The content inside is displayed as <pre> text.
----

==== Literal block

Literal blocks are almost never used.
They are basically a dumbed down version of a <<listing-block,listing block>>.

=== Horizontal rule

A line with three single quotation marks (i.e., `'''`) is a special macro that inserts a thematic break (aka horizontal rule):

'''

Horizontal rules shouldn't be required in the normal course of writing documentation.
However, they are an optional tool available in AsciiDoc that can be used to visually separate content in a pinch.
