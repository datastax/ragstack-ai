= Local Development Environment

Set up a local development environment and install RAGStack.

== Venv
. Install https://www.python.org/downloads/[Python 3.11]{external-link-icon} or higher.
. Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install RAGStack.
+
[source,python]
----
python -m venv <venv-name>
source <venv-name>/bin/activate
pip install ragstack-ai
----
+
. Once you're satisfied with your local environment, freeze its dependencies to a `requirements.txt` file. This file can then be used to recreate the environment elsewhere:
+
[source,python]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----
+
. To take your local environment to a production setting, create a new virtual environment and install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
+
[source,python]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----
+
. To deactivate the virtual environment, type `deactivate`.

== Conda
. Install https://www.anaconda.com/download[Conda]{external-link-icon} or https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/[Miniconda]{external-link-icon}.
. Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install RAGStack.
+
[source,python]
----
conda create --name <venv-name>
conda activate <venv-name>
pip install ragstack-ai
----
+
. Once you're satisfied with your local environment, export it to a YAML file. This file can then be used to recreate the environment elsewhere:
+
[source,bash]
----
conda env export > environment.yml
----
It's a good practice to keep `environment.yml` in version control to ensure reproducibility.
. To take your local environment to a production setting, create a new conda virtual environment from the `environment.yml` file:
+
[source,bash]
----
conda create --name prod-ragstack --clone ragstack-venv
----
This will create a new conda environment with the same packages and versions as your local environment.
. To deactivate the virtual environment, type `conda deactivate`.

== Poetry
[NOTE]
====
Poetry requires Python 3.8+.
====
. Install https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry]{external-link-icon}.
. If you already have a `poetry.lock` file, use `poetry add ragstack-ai` to add RAGStack to your project.
If not, continue to the next step.
. In your application directory, run `poetry init` to create a `pyproject.toml` file.
Poetry will ask you a few questions about your project and create the `.toml` file for you.
+
[source,console]
----
poetry init

This command will guide you through creating your pyproject.toml config.

Package name [temporary-astra]:

Compatible Python versions [^3.11]:

Would you like to define your main dependencies interactively? (yes/no) [yes] yes
Package to add or search for (leave blank to skip): ragstack-ai
Enter package # to add, or the complete package name if it is not listed []:
 [ 0] ragstack-ai
 > 0
Enter the version constraint to require (or leave blank to use the latest version): 
Using version ^0.1.2 for ragstack-ai
----

. When asked `Would you like to define your main dependencies interactively? (yes/no)`, type `yes`.
. When prompted `Package to add or search for (leave blank to skip):`, type `ragstack-ai` and leave the version constraint blank to use the latest version.
. Once the Poetry virtual environment is created, type `poetry shell` to activate it as a nested shell.
. Type `poetry install`. This command reads the `pyproject.toml` file, downloads the latest versions of the dependencies, and installs them in the virtual environment. All packages and their exact versions are written to the `poetry.lock` file, locking the project to those specific versions. You should commit the `poetry.lock` file to your project repo so that all people working on the project are locked to the same versions of dependencies.

== Connect to your vector-enabled {db-serverless} database

RAGStack includes the Astrapy library for connecting your local development environment to your vector-enabled {db-serverless} database.

. If you don't have a vector database, create one at https://astra.datastax.com/.
+
The Astra application token must have Database Administrator permissions (e.g. `AstraCS:WSnyFUhRxsrg…`​).
+
The Astra API endpoint is available in the Astra Portal (e.g. `https://<ASTRA_DB_ID>-<ASTRA_DB_REGION>.apps.astra.datastax.com`).
+
Create an OpenAI key at https://platform.openai.com/ (e.g. `sk-xxxx`).
+
You must have an existing collection in Astra (e.g. `test`).
. Create a `.env` file in the root of your program with the values from your Astra Connect tab.
+
[source,bash]
----
ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN="<AstraCS:...>"
ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT="<Astra DB API endpoint>"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
ASTRA_DB_COLLECTION="test"
----
+
. Test your connection to the database.
Create a vector store and print the contents of the data collection:
+
[NOTE]
====
To install the `load_dotenv` package, run `pip install python-dotenv`.
====
+
[source,python]
----
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_astradb import AstraDBVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

load_dotenv()

ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = os.environ.get("ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN")
ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT = os.environ.get("ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT")
OPEN_AI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
ASTRA_DB_COLLECTION = os.environ.get("ASTRA_DB_COLLECTION")

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vstore = AstraDBVectorStore(
    embedding=embedding,
    collection_name="test",
    token=os.environ["ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN"],
    api_endpoint=os.environ["ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT"],
)
print(vstore.astra_db.collection(ASTRA_DB_COLLECTION).find())
----

. You should get the following output, indicating your collection contains no documents:
+
[source,console]
----
{'data': {'documents': [], 'nextPageState': None}}
----
+
. With your local environment connected to your vector database, continue on to the xref:ROOT:quickstart.adoc#rag-workflow[quickstart] to load data and start querying.
