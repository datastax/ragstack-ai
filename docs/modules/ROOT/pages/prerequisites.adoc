= Notebook Prerequisites

Most of our example notebooks use {db-serverless} as the vector database and OpenAI as the LLM.

. Create an vector-enabled {db-serverless} database at https://astra.datastax.com. For detailed instructions on database creation, see https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/astra-db-vector/administration/manage-databases.html#create-a-serverless-vector-database[Create a serverless vector database].

. Create an OpenAI key at https://platform.openai.com.
. Install RAGStack with `pip install ragstack-ai`.

You'll need these values for the notebooks:
