Use RAGStack, https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/graph/constructing/#llm-graph-transformer[`LLMGraphTransformer`], and https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra[DataStax AstraDB] to extract knowledge triples and store them in a vector database.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This feature is currently under development and has not been fully tested. It is not supported for use in production environments. Please use this feature in testing and development environments only.
====

== Prerequisites

* An active https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra[DataStax AstraDB]
* Python 3.11 (to use `Union` and `self` hints)
* OpenAI API key

== Environment

. Install dependencies:
+
[source,bash]
----
pip install ragstack-ai-knowledge-graph python-dotenv
----
+
. Create a `.env` file and store the necessary credentials.
+
[source,bash]
----
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
ASTRA_DB_DATABASE_ID="670d40c2-80f9-4cb0-8c74-d524dd6944d1"
ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN="AstraCS:..."
ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE="default_keyspace"
----

If you're running the notebook in Colab, run the cell using `getpass` to set the necessary environment variables.

== Create a graph store in Astra

. Import the necessary libraries and load the variables from your `.env` files.

== Query the graph store

. Query the `GraphStore`.
The `as_runnable` method takes some configuration for how to extract the subgraph and returns a LangChain `Runnable`. This `Runnable` can be invoked on a node or sequence of nodes to traverse from those starting points.
+
[source,python]
----
graph_store.as_runnable(steps=2).invoke(Node("Marie Curie", "Person"))
----
+
. For getting started, the library also provides a `Runnable` for extracting the starting entities from a question.
+
[source,python]
----
extract_entities(llm).invoke({ "question": "Who is Marie Curie?"})
----

== Query Chain

Create a chain which does the following:

. Use the entity extraction `Runnable` from the library to
determine the starting points.
. Retrieve the sub-knowledge graphs starting from those nodes.
. Create a context containing those knowledge triples.
. Apply the LLM to answer the question given the context.

== Use KnowledgeSchema instead of LLMGraphTransformer

Instead of using `LLMGraphTransformer` to build your graph, the Knowledge Graph library also includes a unique knowledge extraction system called `KnowledgeSchema` that lets you define your nodes and relationships in a YAML file and load it to guide the graph extraction process.

== Example usage

. Copy the sample `marie_curie_schema.yaml` file https://github.com/datastax/ragstack-ai/blob/main/libs/knowledge-graph/tests/marie_curie_schema.yaml[from the RAGStack repo]. This example assumes you copy it to the same directory as your script.

. Create a new Python script and add the following code. In this example, `KnowledgeSchema` is initialized from a YAML file, the `KnowledgeSchemaExtractor` uses an LLM to extract knowledge from the source according to the YAML-defined schema, and the extracted nodes and relationships are printed.
