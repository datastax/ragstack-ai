= Advanced RAG: MultiQuery and ParentDocument

image::https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg[align="left",link="https://colab.research.google.com/github/datastax/ragstack-ai/blob/main/examples/notebooks/advancedRAG.ipynb"]

This page demonstrates two different advanced RAG techniques: MultiQueryRAG and ParentDocumentRAG.

In *MultiQueryRAG*, an LLM is used to automate the process of prompt tuning, to generate multiple queries from different perspectives for a given user input question.

In *ParentDocumentRAG*, documents are split first into larger "parent" chunks, and then into smaller "child" chunks so that their embeddings can more accurately reflect their meaning. Between the LLM retrieval and inference steps, each smaller "child" chunk is then replaced with its larger "parent" chunk. This provides more context to the model to answer the question.

While both of these techniques can increase the response accuracy, they also can have some drawbacks. Often they take longer to execute, and they can cost more due to increased LLM invocations and/or increased token usage.

== Setup

`ragstack-ai` includes all the packages you need to build a RAG pipeline.

. Install the following libraries.
+
[source,shell]
----
pip install ragstack-ai
----
+
. Import dependencies.
+
[source,python]
----
import os
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parser import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnable import RunnableLambda, RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_community.callbacks import get_openai_callback
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.retrievers import ParentDocumentRetriever
from langchain_community.storage import InMemoryStore
from langchain.text_splitter import TokenTextSplitter
from langchain_astradb import AstraDBVectorStore
----
+
. The two advanced RAG techniques require different dependencies.
Their imports are shown in their respective sections.

== Create helper functions

Create some helper methods for printing docs and results:
[source,python]
----
import textwrap

def pprint_docs(docs):
    print(f"\n{'-' * 70}\n".join([f"Document {i+1}:\n\n" + "\n".join(textwrap.wrap(d.page_content)) for i, d in enumerate(docs)]))

def pprint_result(result):
    print("Answer: " + "\n".join(textwrap.wrap(result)))
----

== Index sample data

. Retrieve the text of a short story that will be indexed in the vector store:
+
[source,python]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CassioML/cassio-website/main/docs/frameworks/langchain/texts/amontillado.txt --output amontillado.txt
input = "amontillado.txt"
----
. Loop through each file and load it into the vector store.
You loaded `amontillado.txt` in the previous step, but this processor can also process PDFs.
+
`SAMPLEDATA = []` clears the list so the same files aren't processed twice.
+
[source,python]
----
documents = []
for filename in SAMPLEDATA:
    path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), filename)

    if filename.endswith(".pdf"):
        loader = PyPDFLoader(path)
        new_docs = loader.load_and_split()
        print(f"Processed pdf file: {filename}")
    elif filename.endswith(".txt"):
        loader = TextLoader(path)
        new_docs = loader.load_and_split()
        print(f"Processed txt file: {filename}")
    else:
        print(f"Unsupported file type: {filename}")

    if len(new_docs) > 0:
        documents.extend(new_docs)

SAMPLEDATA = []

print(f"\nProcessing done.")
----
+
. Build a simple prompt with a set of questions to ask.
You'll use this prompt to gauge the effectiveness of the different RAG techniques.
+
[source,python]
----
prompt_template = """
Answer the question based only on the supplied context. If you don't know the answer, say you don't know the answer.
Context: {context}
Question: {question}
Your answer:
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)

questions = [
    "What motivates the narrator, Montresor, to seek revenge against Fortunato?",
    "What are the major themes in this story?",
    "What is the significance of the story taking place during the carnival season?",
    "How is vivid and descriptive language used in the story?",
    "Is there any foreshadowing in the story? If yes, how is it used in the story?"
]
----
+
. Create one more helper method to iterate over the questions.
You won't ask any questions just yet.
+
[source,python]
----
def do_retrieval(chain):
    for i in range(len(questions)):
        print("-" * 40)
        print(f"Question: {questions[i]}\n")
        with get_openai_callback() as cb:
            pprint_result(chain.invoke(questions[i]))
            print(f'\nTotal Tokens: {cb.total_tokens}\n')
----

== Load and embed documents

For the purpose of this example, you will use a method that is compatible with the advanced ParentDocumentRAG technique.
If you aren't going to use this technique, you can review the xref:ROOT:quickstart.adoc[] example for a simpler document insertion method.

You will create 2 splitters: a parent splitter, and a child splitter.
The parent splitter will split your documents into 512-token documents. The child splitter will split the parent documents into 128-token documents.

Embeddings for the child documents are generated and stored in the vector store.

For this example demo, the parent documents will only be stored in-memory.
In a production system, the parent documents should be stored in a database.

. Create embeddings for the documents and insert them into the {db-serverless} vector store.
+
[source,python]
----
# Initialize the models
model = ChatOpenAI(openai_api_key=openai_api_key, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.1)
embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=openai_api_key)

# Initialize a vector store for storing the child chunks
vstore = AstraDBVectorStore(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    embedding=embedding,
    token=astra_token,
    api_endpoint=astra_endpoint
)

# Initialize in-memory storage for the parent chunks
parent_store = InMemoryStore()

# Create a splitter for the parent documents
parent_splitter = TokenTextSplitter(chunk_size=512, chunk_overlap=0)

# Create a splitter for the child documents
# Note: child documents should be smaller than parent documents
child_splitter = TokenTextSplitter(chunk_size=128, chunk_overlap=0)

# Create a parent document retriever
parent_retriever = ParentDocumentRetriever(
    vectorstore=vstore,
    docstore=parent_store,
    child_splitter=child_splitter,
    parent_splitter=parent_splitter,
)
# Split and load the documents into the vector and parent stores
parent_retriever.add_documents(docs)
----

== Create a base retriever

. As a control, first make a standard RAG pipeline.
+
[source,python]
----
# Standard RAG, nothing fancy
base_retriever = vstore.as_retriever()

base_chain = (
    {"context": base_retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | model
    | StrOutputParser()
)
----

Question: Is there any foreshadowing in the story? If yes, how is it used in the story?

Answer: Yes, there is foreshadowing in the story. The foreshadowing is used to
hint at the fate of Fortunato and the revenge that the narrator plans
to take. The mention of the "low moaning cry" from the depth of the
recess and the "furious vibrations of the chain" suggest that
something ominous and dangerous is happening to Fortunato. This
foreshadows his eventual entrapment and demise in the catacombs.
Additionally, the narrator's mention of wanting to "punish with
impunity" and the idea of a wrong being unredressed when retribution
overtakes its redresser foreshadow the narrator's plan to seek revenge
on Fortunato without facing any consequences.

== Create a MultiQueryRetriever RAG chain

Next, try the advanced MultiQueryRAG technique.

When the MultiQueryRetriever module is used, an additional LLM call is made before retrieval. This call generates multiple versions of the initial question from different perspectives, then retrieval is performed on this set of questions.

[NOTE]
====
This technique requires an additional dependency.

. Build the multi-query retriever:
+
[source,python]
----
from langchain.retrievers.multi_query import MultiQueryRetriever

# Note that this retriever depends on the base_retriever
multi_retriever = MultiQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    retriever=base_retriever, llm=model

----------------------------------------
Question: Is there any foreshadowing in the story? If yes, how is it used in the story?

Answer: Yes, there is foreshadowing in the story. The narrator's mention of
seeking revenge and punishing with impunity foreshadows the events
that unfold later in the story, where the narrator walls up Fortunato
in the catacombs. Additionally, the mention of the "furious vibrations
of the chain" hints at the impending danger and violence that
Fortunato will face.

events. The language is used to describe the dank and damp catacombs,
the chains and padlock that bind the protagonist, and the construction
of the wall that seals the niche. It also describes the sounds and
actions of the characters, such as the moaning cry from the recess and
the low laugh that comes from the niche. Overall, the vivid and
descriptive language helps to immerse the reader in the story and
enhance the suspense and horror elements.

Document 1:

The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but
when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.  You, who so well know
the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave
utterance to a threat.  _At length_ I would be avenged; this was a
point definitely settled--but the very definitiveness with which it
was resolved, precluded the idea of risk.  I must not only punish, but
punish with impunity.  A wrong is unredressed when retribution
overtakes its redresser.  It is equally unredressed when the avenger
fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.  It
must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato
cause to doubt my good will.  I continued, as was my wont, to smile in
his face, and he did not perceive that my smile _now_ was at the
thought of his immolation.  He had a weak point--this Fortunato--
although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even
feared.  He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.  Few
Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their
enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity--to practise
imposture upon the British and Austrian _millionaires_.  In painting
and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack--but in the
matter of old wines he was sincere.  In this respect I did not differ
from him materially: I was skillful in the Italian vintages myself,

  But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I
have my doubts."  "How?" said he.  "Amontillado?  A pipe?  Impossible!
And in the middle of the carnival!"  "I have my doubts," I replied;
"and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without
consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was
fearful of losing a bargain."  "Amontillado!"  "I have my doubts."
"Amontillado!"  "And I must satisfy them."  "Amontillado!"  "As you
are engaged, I am on my way to Luchesi.  If any one has a critical
turn, it is he.  He will tell me--"  "Luchesi cannot tell Amontillado
from Sherry."  "And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a
match for your own."  "Come, let us go."  "Whither?"  "To your
vaults."  "My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature.  I
perceive you have an engagement.  Luchesi--"  "I have no
engagement;--come."  "My friend, no.  It is not the engagement, but
the severe cold with which I perceive you are afflicted.  The vaults
are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre."  "Let us go,
nevertheless.  The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! You have been
imposed upon.  And as for Luchesi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from
Amontillado."  Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm.

gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as
he strode.  "The pipe," said he.  "It is farther on," said I; "but
observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls."  He
turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that
distilled the rheum of intoxication.  "Nitre?" he asked, at length.
"Nitre," I replied.  "How long have you had that cough?"  "Ugh! ugh!
ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!--ugh! ugh! ugh!"
My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.  "It is
nothing," he said, at last.  "Come," I said, with decision, "we will
go back; your health is precious.  You are rich, respected, admired,
beloved; you are happy, as once I was.  You are a man to be missed.
For me it is no matter.  We will go back; you will be ill, and I
cannot be responsible.  Besides, there is Luchesi--"  "Enough," he
said; "the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. I shall not
die of a cough."  "True--true," I replied; "and, indeed, I had no
intention of alarming you unnecessarily--but you should use all proper
caution. A draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps."  Here
I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long row of its
fellows that lay upon the mould.  "Drink," I said, presenting him the
