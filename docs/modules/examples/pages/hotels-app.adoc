This page demonstrates using RAGStack and a vector-enabled {db-serverless} database to build a Hotels Search application.

The application uses a vector-enabled {db-serverless} database to store hotel data, and RAGStack to search for hotels and generate summaries.

See the https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/langchain-astrapy-hotels-app#readme[Hotels App README] for more details on getting the app running (including on Gitpod).

== Prerequisites

. Clone the Git repository and change to that directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/langchain-astrapy-hotels-app.git
cd langchain-astrapy-hotels-app
----
+
. You will need a vector-enabled {db-serverless} database.
+
.. Create an https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/getting-started/create-db-choices.html[Astra
vector database].
+
.. Within your database, create an https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/manage/org/manage-tokens.html[Astra
DB Access Token] with Database Administrator permissions.
+
.. Copy your {db-serverless} API Endpoint for the vector-enabled {db-serverless} database, as displayed in {astra_ui}.
+
. Set the following environment variables in a `.env` file in `langchain-astrapy-hotels-app` (you can use the provided `.env.template` as an example):
+
[source,text]
----
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT=https://<ASTRA_DB_ID>-<ASTRA_DB_REGION>.apps.astra.datastax.com
ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=AstraCS:...
----
+
. Install the required dependencies:
+
[source,python]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----
+
. Verify you have a recent version (7.0+) of `npm` (needed to run the client):
+
[source,bash]
----
npm --version
----

See the https://docs.datastax.com/en/ragstack/examples/prerequisites.html[Prerequisites] page for more details on finding these values.

== Load the data

. From the root folder, run four Python scripts to populate your database with data collections.
+
[tabs]
======
Python::
+
[source,bash]
----
python -m setup.2-populate-review-vector-collection
python -m setup.3-populate-hotels-and-cities-collections
python -m setup.4-create-users-collection
python -m setup.5-populate-reviews-collection
----

Result::
+
[source,console]
----
** [JustPreCalculatedEmbeddings] INFO: embed request for 'This is a sample sentence.'. Returning moot results

[2-populate-review-vector-collection.py] Finished. 10000 rows written.
[3-populate-hotels-and-cities-collections.py] Inserted 1433 hotels
[3-populate-hotels-and-cities-collections.py] Inserted 842 cities
[5-populate-reviews-collection.py] Inserted 10000 reviews
----
======
+
. Each script populates a different collection in your vector-enabled {db-serverless} database, including a collection of precalculated embeddings for vector search.

The application will use these collections to deliver valuable, personalized results to users.

== Run the application

Now that your vector database is populated, run the application frontend to see the results.

. Open a new terminal and start the API server.
+
[source, bash]
----
uvicorn api:app --reload
----
+
. Open a new terminal and change directory to the `client` folder (`cd client`).
Install the node dependencies and start the application.
+
[source, bash]
----
npm install
npm start
----
+
. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.
Click "Login" in the upper right corner, enter any values for the username and password, and click Login.
+
. Enter `US` for the country and a US city for the location, and click Search.
+
. The application lists hotels, including an OpenAI-generated summary of reviews from the reviews collection.
+
. Selecting "Details" will show more information about the hotel, including a summary based on your Preferences, stored in the users collection.
+
. The "Preferences" section lets you edit your profile, so that the "Details" for a hotel will be re-calculated, possibly highlighting different reviews and adapting the AI-generated summary at the top.

== Cleanup

. Use `ctrl+c` in both terminals, to stop the API server and the application.
. Launch the following cleanup script to delete all collections used by the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
python -m setup.cleanup-delete-all-collections
