= Advanced RAG patterns

FLARE
Forward-looking active retrieval, or FLARE, is an example of a multi-query RAG technique that involves iteratively calling the LLM with custom instructions in your prompt that ask the LLM to provide additional questions about key phrases that would help it generate a better answer. Once the LLM has context with no gaps, it terminates with the final response. The process adds a loop between the LLM and the AI agent (the AI chatbot in the diagram) to facilitate these iterations.

RAG Fusion
By generating similar queries to the userâ€™s query and retrieving relevant context for both the original query as well as the generated similar queries, we are able to increase the likelihood that we have selected the most useful context to generate accurate results.
