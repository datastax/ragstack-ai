= Langflow

https://docs.langflow.org[Langflow] is a visual way to build, iterate, and deploy AI applications. Its intuitive interface allows for easy manipulation of AI building blocks, enabling developers to quickly prototype and turn their ideas into powerful, real-world solutions.

A single Langflow "flow" could contain multiple Langchain chat components, a Llama language model, an Astra vector store, and a Redis cache. You can build any AI flow you can think of with Langflow, but how can you be confident that these components are up-to-date and compatible with your project?

Using the `ragstack-ai-langflow` package solves this problem. It provides the intuitive flow building of Langflow, with components tested for compatibility, performance, and security with RAGStack.
